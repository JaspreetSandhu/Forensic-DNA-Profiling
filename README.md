When choosing a pathway to pursue coming out of high-school, my fascination had always been between Science and Technology. I developed this simplistic program as a result of the intersection between my two passions, which exemplifies the integration of software to solve problems faced by many in the real world.

The Python Script that I wrote interacts with databases of sample forensic information from a population of varying size, depicted by the corresponding length of the CSV files. When given a DNA strand to process, the program algorthimically derives the unique combination of Short Tandem Repeats (STRs), sometimes referred to as 'microsatellites', which in modern-day are considered exclusive to every individual organism. With this computed infomration, I was able to match the STR combination to the person to whom it belonged with 100% accuracy as per the test cases situated by Harvard University's CS50x.

To me, this project demonstrates the resource that software provides in addressing the complexities of the modern world. It really goes to show the versatility of algorithmic design, in that if a problem can be conceptualized, then software is the tool that can provide the solution.
